![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)

## Overview
AtmosFusion is a platform built for NCMRWF / Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) to blend physics-based NWP models (GFS, ECMWF, NCUM, WRF) with AI-based weather models (GraphCast, AIFS) using dynamic cell-by-cell weighting.

## Features
- Real-time Multi-Model Consensus Blending
- Interactive 2D/3D Mapping (OpenStreetMap & Google Maps)
- SHAP Explainability for Weight Assignments
- Alert Tracking for Heavy Rainfall Events
